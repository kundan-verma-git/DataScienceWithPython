# Machine Learning With Python

__Machine Learning__ is a latest __buzzword__ floating around. It desrves to, as it is one of the most interesting __subfield__ of __Computer Science__.<br>
__What does Machine learning really means ?__<br>
__Machine learning__ is the scientific __study__ of __algorithms__ and __statistical models__ that __computer systems__ use to effectively __perform a specific task__ without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.<br>
__Machine Learning__ is an __application of artificial intelligence__.<br>
__Machine learning__ algorithms build a mathematical __model__ based on sample data, known as __"training data"__, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.<br>
__Machine learning__ algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as __email filtering__, and __computer vision__.<br>

 __Machine learning__ is uses __computational statistics__ to analyze the __pattern__, which __focuses__ on making __predictions using computers__.<br><br>
## Machine Learning Vs Traditional Programming?
- A __traditional algorithm__ takes some __input__ and some __logic__ in the __form of code__ and returns the __output__. As opposed to this, a __Machine Learning__ Algorithm takes an __input__ and an __output__ and gives the some __logic__ which can then be used to work with new input to give one an output. <br>
