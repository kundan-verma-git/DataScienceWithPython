__Machine Learning__ is a latest __buzzword__ floating around. It desrves to, as it is one of the most interesting __subfield__ of __Computer Science__.<br>
__What does Machine learning really means ?__<br>
__Machine learning__ is the scientific __study__ of __algorithms__ and __statistical models__ that __computer systems__ use to effectively __perform a specific task__ without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.
__Machine Learning__ is an __application of artificial intelligence__.
__Machine learning__ algorithms build a mathematical __model__ based on sample data, known as __"training data"__, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.
__Machine learning__ algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as __email filtering__, and __computer vision__.<br>

 __Machine learning__ is uses __computational statistics__ to analyze the __pattern__, which __focuses__ on making __predictions using computers__.
