- Based on this graph, majority of male people died
- Females and Child have high probability to survive.

## Conclusion :
- Based on this Exploratory Data Analysis we are able to analyse the ratio of survived or died people.
  - __76%__ of __females__ survived.
  - __57%__ of __children__ also survived.
  - Only __16%__ of __males__ survived.
  - Also the survival rate for male is very low irrespective of the class he belongs to and the survival rate is less for all the 3rd class passengers. Almost all women in Pclass 1 and 2 survived and nearly all men in Pclass 2 and 3 died.
