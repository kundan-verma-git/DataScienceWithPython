__What does Exploratory Data Analysis really means?__<br>
__Exploratory Data Analysis__ refers to the critical process of performing initial __investigations on data__ so as to discover __patterns__,to spot __anomalies__,to __test hypothesis__ and to check __assumptions__ with the help of summary __statistics and graphical representations__.<br>
__Which type of tasks tackle EDA?__<br>
- Spotting mistakes and missing data
- Mapping out the underlying structure of the data
- Identifying the most important variables
- Listing anomalies and outliers
- Testing a hypotheses / checking assumptions related to a specific model
- Establishing a parsimonious model (one that can be used to explain the data with minimal predictor variables);
- Estimating parameters and figuring out the associated confidence intervals or margins of error.<br>
## Data Analysis Process<br>
![image.pmg](images/data_analysis.png)<br>
The process of __evaluating data__ using __analytical and logical reasoning__ to examine each component of the __data__ provided.
## Recomended Process for Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Look at the __structure of the data__: number of data points, __number of features__, __feature names__, __data types__, etc.
- When dealing with __multiple data sources__, check for __consistency__ across __datasets__.
- Identify what data signifies (called measures) for each of data points and be mindful while obtaining metrics.
- Calculate __key metrics__ for each __data point__ (summary analysis): 
  - a. __Measures of central tendency__ (Mean, Median, Mode)
  - b. __Measures of dispersion__ (Range, Quartile Deviation, Mean Deviation, Standard Deviation)
  - c. __Measures of skewness and kurtosis__.
- Investigate visuals: a. __Histogram__ for each variable; b. __Scatterplot__ to correlate variables.
- Calculate __metrics__ and __visuals__ per category for __categorical variables (nominal, ordinal)__.
- Identify __outliers__ and mark them. Based on context, either __discard outliers__ or analyze them separately.
- Estimate __missing points__ using data __imputation techniques__.
## Data Visualisation

__Data visualization__ is the __graphical representation__ of __information__ and __data__. By using __visual elements__ like __charts__, __graphs__, and __maps__, __data visualization__ tools provide an accessible way to __see__ and __understand trends__, __outliers__, and __patterns__ in __data__.<br>
-  one of the best ways to understand the data is visualization.
- In the __world of Big Data__, __data visualization__ tools and technologies are essential to __analyze massive amounts of information__ and make data-driven decisions.
